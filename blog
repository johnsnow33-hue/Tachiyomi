Tachiyomi has become the go-to app for manga lovers who prefer freedom, customization, and simplicity.
It’s more than just a reader — it’s a community-driven platform that changes the way fans experience manga.

Unlike most commercial apps, Tachiyomi is completely free and open source.
It doesn’t rely on ads or trackers, making it one of the most trusted tools for manga reading.

At its core, Tachiyomi lets users read manga from multiple online sources through its extension system.
These extensions act like mini-connectors that link the app to different manga websites.

Readers can install only the sources they want — giving them total control over their experience.
This flexibility has made Tachiyomi extremely popular among users worldwide.

But while the app is easy to use, finding a safe and updated APK can be tricky.
That’s exactly why we built tachiyomapk.com
 — a site dedicated to verified Tachiyomi downloads and trusted updates.

On our website, you’ll always find the latest Tachiyomi APK, installation guides, and version changelogs.
We make sure every file is secure, current, and works smoothly on Android devices.

We also cover useful topics like how to install Tachiyomi on PC, how to update extensions, and how to fix common issues.
This helps new users get started without the confusion that often comes with open-source apps.

Our goal is to simplify everything — from downloading the app to managing your manga library.
We keep the experience clean, user-friendly, and completely transparent.

Tachiyomi itself continues to grow through community contributions on GitHub.
Developers around the world constantly add features, improve performance, and maintain new extensions.

If you’re hosting your blog on GitHub, you can even link directly to those contributions.
It’s a great way to show your readers how open-source development works in real time.

, we follow every update closely and share practical guides for every new release.

They let you access thousands of manga titles from global sources, all in one interface.

Each extension can be easily installed and updated through the Tachiyomi app or our website.
